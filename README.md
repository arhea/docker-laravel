# Dockerized Laravel
The purpose of these images are to be production ready images to deploy your applications. The project is made up of two components: php and NGINX. PHP runs the official PHP image from Docker Hub with Laravel specific configuration. NGINX is the proxy in front of your application that communicates with PHP-FPM over the FastCGI protocol.
